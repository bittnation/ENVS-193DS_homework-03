# Problem 1. Personal Data

## a. Data Summarizing

I could calculate the mean hours of productivity to compare between locations, such as home versus the library, because I suspect that my environment affects how focused I am. This comparison would help determine if studying in the library leads to longer or more productive work sessions than working at home.

## b. Visualization

```{r message=FALSE}

personal_data <- read_csv("Personal_data_1.csv") #reading in data frame

```

```{r  warning=FALSE}

personal_data_clean <- personal_data |>
   clean_names() |>
   filter(location %in% c("Home", "Library")) |> #filter to include only observations from home and library
  select(hours_of_productivity_hh_mm, location) |> #selecting only the columns with data of interest
  separate(hours_of_productivity_hh_mm, into = c("hrs", "mins"), sep = ":", convert = TRUE) |>
  mutate(productivity_hours = hrs + mins / 60) #separating hours and minutes to calculate productivity in terms of hours

```

```{r data-plot}
ggplot(data = personal_data_clean, #choosing data set
       aes(x = location, 
           y = productivity_hours, 
           fill = location)) + #setting axis 
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_jitter(height = 0, width = 0.2, alpha = 0.6) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Home" = "#008080", "Library" = "#800080")) + #choosing custom colors 
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Productivity Hours by Location", #giving plot a title
       x = "Location", y = "Productivity (hours)") + #labeling axis
  theme(legend.position = "none")  #removing legend


```

**Figure 1.** Box plot showing the distribution of daily productivity hours by location. Each box represents the interquartile range (IQR) of productivity values, with the horizontal line indicating the median. Whiskers extend to values within 1.5 times the IQR, and individual points represent daily observations. Fill colors indicate study location: teal for Home (n = 7) and purple for Library (n = 8). Productivity hours were calculated by converting reported time values from HH:MM format to decimal hours.

## d. Table Presentation

```{r table}

summary_table <- personal_data_clean |> #creating summary data set
  group_by(location) |> #grouping all values by location: Library or home
  summarise(
    n = n(), #including sample size
    mean_productivity = round(mean(productivity_hours, na.rm = TRUE), 1),#calculating mean hours of productivity and rounding to one decimal point
    sd_productivity = round(sd(productivity_hours, na.rm = TRUE), 1) # calculating standard deviation in hours and rounding to one decimal point
  )

summary_table |> #putting calculated values into the format of a summary table
  flextable() |>
  set_header_labels( #labeling column headers
    location = "Location",
    n = "Sample Size (n)",
    mean_productivity = "Mean Productivity (hours)",
    sd_productivity = "SD (hours)"
  ) |>
  autofit() |> # cleaning table format
  set_caption("Table 1. Summary of productivity hours by location.") #captioning summary table
```

Table 1. Summary of productivity hours by location

# Problem 2. Affective Visualization

## a.

My personal data affective visualization could be a strip based piece of art where each day is represented by a rectangle of various colors and sizes. The length of the strip would be representative of total hours of productivity, the longer the strip the more hours. The color of the strip would be representative of caffeine intake, darker colors indicate a higher caffeine intake and lighter colors indicate a lower caffeine intake. I would use a coffee inspired color palate to create an aesthetic connection to the data.

## a.

![](images/crituque-figure.png)

This figure depicts a scatter plot of total organic matter (TOM, %) against percent mud content across four habitat types present along the California Coast: sea grass, bare sediment, salt marsh, and pan. Each point along the graph represents an individual sediment sample, visually comparing TOM and grain size across habitats. A linear regression was used to test for a statistically significant relationship between TOM and grain size (% mud). The goal of this statistical analysis was to determine how sediment size influences accumulation of organic matter in different habitats along the California Coast.

## b.

Although the author made a clear description and analysis in the text, the figure itself doesn't provide a clear visual representation of the model results. The figure lacks a regression line, R\^2 value, and p-value. The figures ability to convey the outcome of the linear regression is limited due to the lack of these elements.

## c.

This figure is ascetically clear; it is clean, easy to interpret, and straight forward. The data: ink ratio is high, the focus of the figure is to display individual data points and there are is no unnecessary visual clutter. The legend and shapes distinguishing habitat type aids in visual understanding without over complicating the figure.

## d.

To improve the figure, I recommend adding regression lines, and R\^2 value, and p-values to clearly illustrate the significance and strength of relationships as described in the text. Without these visual elements the readers are forced to connect what they have read to the visualization instead of providing concise and informative figure. The author could even go further to include confidence intervals to demonstrate uncertainty. These added visual elements would allow the figure to standalone instead of relying on text to convey a summary of the data.
